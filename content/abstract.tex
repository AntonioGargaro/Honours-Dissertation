Outlining the development towards an active web based trading program - or `bot' - that continuously performs technical analysis on cryptocurrencies' historical and real time market data. Discussion of related literature on algorithmic trading, technical trend indicators and the cryptocurrency market has developed the requirements for this project. They are derived from the discussion on the trade process and is one of the primary methods this project will be evaluated against. A project plan concludes this paper to illustrate the planned approach towards the development of the bot.
