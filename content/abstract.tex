An active trading program, or 'bot', that continuously performs technical analysis on the market's historical and real time data to generate 'buy' or 'sell' signals. These buy and sell signals will be generated by trading indicators which are at the valley and peaks of candlestick trading charts as to generate the maximum possible return on investment (ROI). The bot can then execute trades based on the trade signals received and inform the user of all actions taken.
