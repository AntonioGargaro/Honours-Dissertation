The outlined development towards a web based application that continuously performs technical analysis on cryptocurrencies' historical and real time market data to generate signals in an attempt to confirm the markets direction. Discussion of related literature on algorithmic trading, technical trend indicators, the cryptocurrency market and web based technologies has developed the direction and requirements of this project. The evaluation on the comparison of technical indicators and their strategies determining the direction of the market concludes that some indicators perform poorly in a sideways market. Some indicators display results that handle sideways markets more effectively in comparison to others, most capture significant movements in trends as they happen. A usability evaluation has been conducted with experienced and inexperienced users of the cryptocurrency market that determines that the web app has a learning curve that correlates with not using similar web apps previously. Users that are familiar with similar web apps display intuitiveness towards this web app, and steps of future work have been suggested to reduce the learning curve. Finally, a test suite has been created to ensure the implemented web technologies sport robust and varied responses of exceptional scenarios.
