The boom of Cryptocurrencies and the youth of their markets allows for a new possibility of volatile trading. However, capitalising on this market by trading on human emotions, impulses or availability can lead to error prone decisions or missed opportunities. A bot is entirely more capable of handling these issues that institutional trading on the stock market accounted for 61\% or 6.73 billion shares\cite{WEB:Cheng:2017} per day by algorithmic trading in 2009. With constant availability and real time analysis, bots can react fast to sudden market changes, long or short a currency and minimise loss through technical analysis of market indicators.
